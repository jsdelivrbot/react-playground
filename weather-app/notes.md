Action Creators always return an "action" (an object that has a type)

axios - ajax request library

connect containers to redux library using connect method

get datta to container Component
import conntect function
define map state to props
pull data into container


promise object

redux-promise will stop an action coming thru the middleware until the promise payload is resolved!  it then passes the action thru to the reducers

reducers return a new instance of state - never mutate state
